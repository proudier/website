<h2>eCountor</h2>
<p>At the time of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWNr9FBJhqQ" target="_blank">56k modems</a>, ISP Club-Internet offered an 20hrs web access package, including telecommunication fees, for about 15&euro;. Unfortunately, the ISP and Windows did not account for the connected time the same way. Basically Windows started counting when a TCP/IP connection was available whereas the ISP started counting as soon as the modem was dialing. By the end of the month, I could observe a 45mins delta.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find any software taking this difference into account, so I wrote one! It was freely available on French freeware repository. Sadly, I lost the source sometime ago because of a system crash (yeah, yeah, I do backups since then).</p>
<p>Technology: C, using the Win32 PSDK (&ldquo;Platform SDK&rdquo;) and the RAS API.</p>
