<p>I was a member of the student union back in my college years (BDE Majeistic).</p>
<h1>Campaign site</h1>
<p>From a design made by the Artist of the team (Anys), given to me under the form of an Photoshop file, I extracted the assets and animated them inside a Flash animation.</p>
<p>I also developed a simple guest book in PHP for the need of this campaign site.</p>
<p>A limited version of the site is online <a href="http://www.pierreroudier.net/majeistic/site/" target="_blank">here</a>, though&nbsp;most of the externals links are broken and the videos are not available.</p>
<p>Technologies: Adobe Flash CS3, LAMP.</p>
<h1>Online voting platform</h1>
<p>One of the tradition from the School of Engineering I graduaded in, is the election of students in categories such as "dancer of the year" , "couple of the year", &hellip;&nbsp;The event takes place once a year and is called "Fintz d'Or", after the Dean's name ("Nesim Fintz").</p>
<p>For this event, I developed a Rich Internet Application using&nbsp;Adobe Flex and REST web-services to power the UI. Everything: from the list of categories to auto-completion of the students' name was made dynamically using WS calls.</p>
<p>Once again, the design was based on a concept provided by our Artist (Anys).</p>
<p>A mock-up &nbsp;is available online <a href="http://www.pierreroudier.net/majeistic/vote/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Technologies: Adobe Flex, LAMP.</p>
