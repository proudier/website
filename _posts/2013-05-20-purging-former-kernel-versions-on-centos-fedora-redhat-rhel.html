<p>How to purge the old, not-used-anymore versions of the Linux kernel on Fedora, CentOS and RedHat (RHEL), in one line.<!--more--></p>
<p><code>package-cleanup --oldkernels --count=2</code></p>
<p>Requires the <code>yum-utils</code> package to be installed.</p>
<p><em>2</em> is the number of version you want to keep, including the lastest version. In other word a value of 2 means 1 active kernel and 1 former version.</p>
