<p>Answer is: alphabetically.<!--more--></p>
<p>Most GNU/Linux distribution come preconfigured with a folder storing modular config files for Apache HTTPd.<br />
On RedHat and CentOS systems, this folder is <code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/</code></p>
<p>These configuration files are taken into account because of the <code>Include</code> directive found in <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code></p>
<p>[text toolbar=false]<br />
#<br />
# Load config files from the config directory "/etc/httpd/conf.d".<br />
#<br />
Include conf.d/*.conf<br />
[/text]</p>
<p>The doc about the Include directive states that wildcard are allowed and the replacement is assured to be alphabetically (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/core.html#include" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>Shell-style (fnmatch()) wildcard characters can be used in the filename or directory parts of the path to include several files at once, in alphabetical order.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because the order is fixed, sysadmins can split <code>VirtualHost</code> configurations in different files.<br />
I tend to have one file per vhost; each file being name after the corresponding host name. Finally, I name <code>aaa_vhost.conf</code> the file used to define the default vhost.</p>
