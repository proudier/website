<h1>nSquare</h1>
<p>nSquare was a monolitic kernel, running in 32bits ("protected mode") on the x86 platform. It embedded a keyboard and a VGA console driver.</p>
<p>It was able to load executables from memory and start them as processes. The CPU time was then shared in a round-robin fashion. The bootstrap process was based on Grub.</p>
<p>The debugging was done by running the kernel inside <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Bochs</a>, an IA-32 emulator.</p>
<p>Sadly, I lost the source sometime ago because of a system crash (yeah, yeah, I do backups since then).</p>
<p>A must read on the topic: "Operating Systems: Design And Implementation" by Andrew S. TANENBAUM.</p>
<p>Technology: x86 assembler, C.</p>
<h1>Pierre's Lib</h1>
<p>The development of nSquare required a lot of documentation and looking for it took some time (<del>search engines</del>Google were not as good as today). So I decided to share what I found through a website: <a href="http://pierrelib.pagesperso-orange.fr/" target="_blank">Pierre's Library</a>.</p>
<p>I had totally forgotten about this site for a while. And I was very surprised when I found it was still online!</p>
<p>Technology: HTML with Macromedia Dreamweaver (hadn't been bought by Adobe at the time).</p>
